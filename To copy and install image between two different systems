We should have two machines connected to eachother , we will use ssh server for this process
Follows steps below:

# docker commit futrons futrons:v1 -> This will copy full conatiner futrons into a image futrons:v1 image

# docker save futrons:v1 futrons:v1.tar -> This will copy full image futrons:v1 into a tar file futrons:v1.tar

# scp futrons.tar root@192.168.43.7:/root --> To send to other system with ip 192.168.43.7

These steps to be done in other system

# docker save futrons:v1.tar futrons:v1 -> This will load and install the image futrons:v1 from the tar file futrons:v1.tar

Now the other system can run this image using docker run command
